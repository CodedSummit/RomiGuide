Getting started instructions for learning to program the Romi robots.

This guide can be found at: https://github.com/CodedSummit/RomiGuide

## Robot Setup
- Remove the robot from the case, and set it on the test stand. Turn it on with the power switch on the edge of the circuit board.
  - Note: It's a good idea to use fresh batteries to avoid complications. Recharge the batteries in the Romi and replace with a fresh set.
- Plug the wifi USB adapter into a USB port on the computer.
- Plug the XBox Controller into a USB port on the computer.
- Connect to the wifi access point ending with the code on the Romi's sticker: `WPILibPi-code>` with password: `WPILib2021!`
- Start WPI VSCode to edit your robot program. (See Programming Section)

## Robot Takedown
- Switch off the Romi with the on-off switch, then press the button next to it until all the lights power off.
- Return the robot, test stand, wifi USB adapter, and XBox Controller to the case.
